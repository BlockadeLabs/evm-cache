Things I've done to speed up the ingestion process, and updating data across more than half of the transaction / log records at once:
- increase workmem to 1 GB, reduce random_page_cost to 1
- turn off sequential scan
- increase iops for the disk on RDS
- add indexes in some columns
- remove indexes in altered / updated columns
- turn on / off triggers
- run parallel nodes to pull in data
- \copy to and from
